This is an example of a minimum program. As you would imagine, it doesn't do much!

Normally we would use make, cmake to build an application, but this time we will
be different just because we can!

Compile and run this minimum program by typing in your terminal:
./run.sh

To run the executable after running the above, type:
./minimal

Actually we lied a little about it not doing much. It does return value of 0.
For more information on return values you may want to look at bash-easy.
